### Skeptic Level Progression Table

|Level  |	Abilities             |
|:-----:|-----------------------|
|3      |	Basic Education       |
|6      |	Inquiry               |
|14     |	Accurate Predictions  |

### Abilities
Basic Education
: You gain proficiency in the Investigation skill and can use it to challenge and question the assumptions of others.

Inquiry
: Upon 6th level, you may use your Insight (Wisdom) skill to determine not only when someone is deceiving you, but when they are deceiving themself. If someone is telling an untruth, whether they believe it or not, a DC 12 Insight check will uncover it.

Accurate Predictions
: Beginning at 14th level, your understanding of the physical world and the weaknesses of humanoid cognition has granted you uncanny powers of prediction. Add your philosopher level to your initiative rolls.
