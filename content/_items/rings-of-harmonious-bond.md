These delicate rings are crafted from intertwining bands of silver and gold, symbolizing unity and balance. When worn, they seem to pulse with a gentle, warm light.

##### Magic Bond
The Rings of Harmonious Bond come in pairs and require attunement by two individuals who must willingly accept each other as partners. The attunement process involves a ritual marriage conducted by a priest or cleric capable of performing magical rituals. Once attuned, the rings create a powerful empathetic link between the wearers.

##### Charm of Friendship
While both wearers are wearing the rings and are within 60 feet of each other, they are under the effect of the Friends spell, but without its usual ending condition that makes the creature hostile afterward. This effect creates a strong bond of trust and friendship, allowing the wearers to communicate and cooperate with remarkable harmony.

##### Bond Limitations
The charm effect is constant and does not require concentration, but it only affects the two individuals attuned to the rings. If one of the rings is removed or one of the wearers dies, the charm effect ends immediately for the other wearer.

##### Ritual Significance
The marriage ritual that binds the wearers to the rings is sacred and significant. If the ritual is ever desecrated, or the bond is betrayed by either party (as determined by the DM), the rings lose their magic until a proper atonement is made.

These rings foster unity and understanding, making them invaluable to those who wish to deepen their bonds and work seamlessly together.
