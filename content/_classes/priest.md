flavor-text: "Amidst a campsite's flickering firelight, the adventurers rested, nursing their wounds from a skirmish with the vicious Snackers. Kael, their Priest, quickly prepared a makeshift stone altar, placing upon it his sacred book of rites. He chanted softly, invoking the Mending Wounds ritual.


Each member approached in turn. For the ranger, Kael traced symbols over deep bite marks, which sealed as he passed. The mage, drained from the fight, sipped from a chalice Kael offered, her strength visibly returning.


The ritual's final words resonated through the camp, imbuing a palpable energy. The once weary group now stood rejuvenated, their grateful eyes on Kael. Under the emerging stars, the bond between them deepened, a testament to shared battles and the healing power of faith."
