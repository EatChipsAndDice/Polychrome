flavor-text: "Gurni? It's where we outlast and outsmart the lot of 'em. We're the thorn in the side of Hringurheim, hidden by trees and falls. Don't need much, don't want much. You're either born here or you ain't, and if you ain't, well, good luck finding us. We stick to our own, and the forest keeps our secrets. That's Gurni for ya."

Nestled in the secluded reaches of the [Hand of Boemon](/locations/hand-of-boemon), the Village of Gurni lies hidden at the base of a cascading waterfall, shrouded by the dense and whispering canopy of the Toringh Forest. Founded 150 years ago by draft dodgers fleeing the turmoil of Hringurheim, this small settlement has thrived in its isolation, developing a culture deeply rooted in independence and self-reliance. The villagers, wary of external influences, maintain a cautious relationship with their former homeland, trading necessities on rare occasions and begrudgingly acknowledging their fealty during the infrequent visits of Hringurheim’s soldiers.

Gurni’s governance is as minimal as its contact with the outside world, with no formal leadership structure in place. Instead, the villagers uphold a tradition of seniority rights, where the longest-standing members of the community are given deference in resolving disputes and making decisions. This system underscores the village's emphasis on respect for history and experience, fostering a close-knit community bound by mutual trust and shared values. The annual festival, a peculiar tradition where villagers retreat into the woods for a week of festivity, serves both as a communal bonding experience and a strategic drill, preparing for potential threats with a blend of revelry and readiness.

The environment plays a crucial role in the villagers' lifestyle, with the bountiful basin at the waterfall's base providing fresh water that merges with the Gravian River. The surrounding Toringh Forest, while a source of sustenance through hunting and gathering, also poses dangers with its resident wolves and lurking bandits. Despite these threats, or perhaps because of them, the villagers of Gurni have cultivated a resilient and self-sufficient community, their small gardens dotting the landscape as a testament to their tenacity. In this serene yet vigilant settlement, the echoes of the waterfall and the rustle of the Black Needle Pines are constant reminders of the delicate balance between the tranquility of isolation and the vigilance for survival.
