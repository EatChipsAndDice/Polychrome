The Port of Lost Sons, Alamar's bustling heart, pulses with the ceaseless rhythm of maritime trade and adventure. This sprawling harbor, a nexus of commerce and cultural exchange, sees ships from distant lands, their sails billowing like the breath of the world, converging upon its docks. Here, the air is thick with the scent of salt and spices, the clamor of merchants haggling over exotic goods, and the melodious languages of far-off nations mingling with the cries of seagulls. The port is a living tableau of Alamar's economic might and its pivotal role in the slave trade, casting a shadow over the vibrant tapestry of activity. Yet, amidst the commerce and navigation, there exists a brotherhood among the sailors and fishermen, bound by the shared respect for the capricious sea and their patron deity, Ecadia. The Port of Lost Sons stands as a testament to Alamar's prowess on the sea, its welcoming arms extended to the wealth of the oceans and the mysteries they hold.
