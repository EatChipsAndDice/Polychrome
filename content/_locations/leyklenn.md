The frosty forests of the northwest Tradelands are dominated by the largest freshwater lake on Oda, Mik'Tarn. The Leyklenn is home to numerous fur bearing animals, most prominently Red and Golden Beavers, Snow Fox and Forest Cats. The trade in these furs is the core of the Leyklenn economy, and a multitude of human trade companies have been set up on the coast of Mik'Tarn with the aim of dominating this trade. The Trade Companies are embroiled in conflict with local Tulggic tribes, due to human hunting parties encroachment on traditional Tulgg lands.
