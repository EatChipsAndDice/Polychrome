An arctic continent dominated by the Øyvklakk. The south is a wasteland, due to the presence of Phortrex Phrakko, a [Gnallix](races/gnallix) resource extraction facility whose run-off has rendered the Øyvklakk oily and acidic. The north is Tundra, and home to the [Durrhaic](races/durrha) kingdom of Ardonnh.
