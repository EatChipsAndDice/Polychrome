An immense plateau of forests and towering peaks. The Hand of Boemon is said to have been raised up from below by Boemon himself during the course of the Gods' War, to serve as a fortress for his warriors. To this day, the Cult of Boemon is strongest here, and City-Kings are chosen by a vote of his priests.The temperate alpine climate and good volcanic soil makes the Hand a rich agricultural region.
