The fantasy city of Alamar is an island city, elegantly situated within the Grand Marian Bay to the south of the enigmatic Dead Gods' Sea. Renowned for its opulence and cultural richness, Alamar stands as a beacon of Marian culture, drawing visitors and traders from across the known world.

The Port of Lost Sons, Alamar's bustling heart, pulses with the ceaseless rhythm of maritime trade and adventure. This sprawling harbor, a nexus of commerce and cultural exchange, sees ships from distant lands, their sails billowing like the breath of the world, converging upon its docks. Here, the air is thick with the scent of salt and spices, the clamor of merchants haggling over exotic goods, and the melodious languages of far-off nations mingling with the cries of seagulls. The port is a living tableau of Alamar's economic might and its pivotal role in the slave trade, casting a shadow over the vibrant tapestry of activity. Yet, amidst the commerce and navigation, there exists a brotherhood among the sailors and fishermen, bound by the shared respect for the capricious sea and their patron deity, Ecadia. The Port of Lost Sons stands as a testament to Alamar's prowess on the sea, its welcoming arms extended to the wealth of the oceans and the mysteries they hold.

Governance in Alamar is an affair of elegance and power, with the city ruled by Matriarchs from influential families, showcasing a unique societal structure where matriarchal wisdom and guidance are paramount. The city thrives on a bustling economy fueled by extensive trade networks. Notably, its prosperity is partly built on a controversial foundationâ€”the slave trade, with many slaves coming from the Savage Hills, underscoring a dark facet of its affluence.

Alamar is also the spiritual heartland of the Marian people, centering around the worship of Ecadia, the revered Goddess of the Sea and Mothers. This religious devotion permeates every aspect of life in Alamar, from the grand ceremonies at the Grand Basilica of the Sea Mother to the daily prayers of its citizens.

The city is a place of stark contrasts. Ratside, the poorest quarter of Alamar, is a stark reminder of the city's inequalities. It is home to Alamar's surplus sons and known for its harsh living conditions, standing in sharp contrast to the city's wealthier areas such as Rosebush Boulevard and Nitos-On-Sea, which are the epitome of luxury and affluence.
