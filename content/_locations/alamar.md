Governance in Alamar is an affair of elegance and power, with the city ruled by Matriarchs from influential families, showcasing a unique societal structure where matriarchal wisdom and guidance are paramount. The city thrives on a bustling economy fueled by extensive trade networks. Notably, its prosperity is partly built on a controversial foundationâ€”the slave trade, with many slaves coming from the Savage Hills, underscoring a dark facet of its affluence.

The city is a place of stark contrasts. The [Port of Lost Sons](/locations/port-of-lost-sons), Alamar's bustling heart, pulses with the ceaseless rhythm of maritime trade and adventure. [Ratside](/locations/ratside), the poorest quarter of Alamar, is a stark reminder of the city's inequalities. It is home to Alamar's surplus sons and known for its harsh living conditions, standing in sharp contrast to the city's wealthier areas such as Rosebush Boulevard and Nitos-On-Sea, which are the epitome of luxury and affluence.
