The Treasury of Mon Aralim stands as a powerful testament to Alamar's wealth and financial prowess. Seamlessly blending opulence with strategic brilliance, this imposing structure is nestled in the heart of the city, its gleaming marble fa√ßades adorned with intricate carvings depicting maritime triumphs and the protective gaze of Ecadia, the Sea Mother. Inside, vaulted ceilings rise above chambers bustling with activity, where rows of scribes meticulously manage ledgers and transactions under the scrutiny of matriarchal financiers who safeguard Alamar's riches.

Clients seeking loans or secure storage are guided through elaborately frescoed corridors to private negotiation rooms, where deals are brokered in whispers that carry the weight of empires. Below, a labyrinth of fortified vaults lies carved into the bedrock beneath the Treasury, housing treasures from across Oda and beyond. Guarded by clerics attuned to Ecadia's will and fortified by powerful enchantments, these vaults ensure that only those deemed worthy can enter their depths. The air is thick with the hum of magic, where shimmering wards protect against intruders and signal any breach.

The clerics of Ecadia meticulously patrol the corridors, their unwavering devotion reinforcing the security that safeguards the wealth of Alamar. The vaults themselves hold ornate chests and reliquaries, protected by intricate locks and potent wards. These contain the accumulated fortunes of Alamar, ensuring the city's wealth remains beyond the reach of those who dare covet it.

Alamar's control extends far beyond its shores through an annual tribute system imposed on other Marian settlements. This tribute constitutes much of the wealth stored within the Treasury, yet Alamar keeps the identities of those who comply and those who don't shrouded in secrecy. Instead, the city wages covert economic warfare against non-compliant settlements. Fueling these efforts is a secretive faction called The Tide, whose agents operate in the shadows, maintaining unity between the Marian diaspora and the metropole through clandestine activities.

The Treasury of Mon Aralim is not only a bastion of wealth but also the cornerstone of Alamar's commercial influence. It serves as a nerve center where business is conducted with ruthless precision, reinforcing the city's economic dominance across the region. With divine favor and unwavering resolve guarding its assets, the Treasury ensures that Alamar's legacy remains firmly entrenched.`
