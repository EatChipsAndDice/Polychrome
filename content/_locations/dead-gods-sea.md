The Dead Gods' Sea is the dominant feature of the western Tradelands. It is densely populated on the coast, but its interior remains wild. The Dead Gods' Sea saw greater devastation than any other region during the Godswar, but has rapidly recovered. It is not the second most populous region within the Tradelands, behind Dal Barun.
