The northern most of these sub-tropical islands are covered in densest jungle, while the southern most are arid deserts. People living on these islands are often very isolated, even from each other, due to the treacherous nature of seas surrounding them. Most of the islands are inhabited by either the Sun-O, a race of [Human](/human) pygmies, or the Sun-Yi, a small population of [Durrha](/durrha) that have developed in isolation from their arctic brothers.
