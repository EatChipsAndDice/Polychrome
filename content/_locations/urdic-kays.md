The Urdic Kays have the highest concentration of Urdstone anywhere on Oda. Many companies have created fortified mines to extract and refine the material into Urd. The landscape was once green and fertile, but aggressive strip mining has rendered it a brown-black morass of mud and stone. People who remain in the kays for significant period of time come down with a illness that causes fatigue and fever within months, and those that do not leave the islands eventually develop sores and tumors. Many of the richest factions on Oda have a stake in the Urdic Kays, but none of the stakeholders personally attend to them.
