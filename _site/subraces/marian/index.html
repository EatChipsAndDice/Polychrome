<h3 id="second-and-third-and-fourth-sons">Second (and third, and fourth..) Sons</h3>
<p>Marian women have an unusual tendency toward birthing male children. More than 3 out of 4 live Marian births are to boys, and because of this, there is a pronounced surplus of male Marians. Perhaps due to their scarcity, women in Marian society are generally more highly valued, and Marian family and political life has taken a distinctly matriarchal form.</p>
