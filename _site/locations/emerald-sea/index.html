        <p>The Emerald Sea is one of the Four Cardinal Seas. It is a picturesque and peaceful region, with small country hamlets dotting the coastline. These hamlets are independent, and decisions are made in town meetings in which each household gets a vote. Men of the Emerald Sea largely by hunting dolphins and whales. These sailors often tell tales of seeing great cities below the waves, and armored men that swim effortlessly along their ships. There are many shipwrecks in the sea, some of which are said to be haunted by the ghosts of those who died aboard.</p>
