      <div class="page-content">
        <p>Opal Point is a bustling port city, strategically positioned at the northernmost tip of the southern coast of the <a href="locations/dead-gods-seas">Dead Gods’ Sea</a>. As the largest city in the Savage Hills, it serves as a pivotal hub for commerce and culture in the region.</p>

<p>Opal Point maintains close, yet subordinate, relations with the Trade Merkatinates of Bayzold. This connection facilitates a steady flow of goods and services, ensuring that Opal Point remains a significant player in regional trade despite its subordinate status.</p>

<p>The city’s economy thrives on the lucrative trade of silk, produced by magically charmed spiders in the hinterlands of the <a href="/locations/savage-hills">Savage Hills</a>. This unique silk, renowned for its quality and enchanting properties, attracts merchants and buyers from far and wide.</p>

<p>Opal Point also harbors a thriving, albeit illegal, slave market. Hidden from the public eye and operating in secrecy, this underground market caters to the darker desires of the city’s elite and visiting traders, contributing to a shadow economy that persists despite official prohibitions.</p>

<p>Opal Point’s combination of strategic location, unique silk trade, and clandestine markets make it a city of intrigue and opportunity, drawing a diverse population of adventurers, traders, and those seeking to exploit its hidden depths.</p>
