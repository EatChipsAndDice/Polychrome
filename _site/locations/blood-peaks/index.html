        <p>The Blood Peaks are a tall, jagged range of mountains that splits the Tradelands down the center. It has also been called the World Spine. The Blood Peaks earned their current name during the Gods’ War, when the Herule killed Oraxis, spilling his blood and intestines across the peaks. As Oraxis bled, his blood formed rivers that filled the valleys between the mountains. Few animals live in the the Blood Peaks, as most have been hunted to extinction by the <a href="/races/orxis">Orxis</a>. Few non-Orxis humanoids live in the Blood Peaks, and those that do are hardy and dangerous. The Blood Peaks are home to many ancient ruins, dating back to the time of the Gods’ War. It is rumored that powerful artifacts can still be found in these ruins, if one knows where to look.</p>
