<p>Several broken columns rise from the dirt, all that remains of an ancient temple. Brambles, vines, and dust have claimed the rest of the temple. Legend has it that a great treasure was once held below the foundations of this temple, dedicated to Garulia, a local deity killed during the Godswar. The foundation has eroded away, and the entrance to the subterranean treasure has disappeared with it.</p>

  <div class="layout-grid">
    <p>A successful History, Religion, or Survival check (DC 15) will reveal the approximate location of the entrance. However, the entrance is now home to a <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16895-giant-spider">giant wolf spider</a>. When a character is within 10 feet of the entrance, a trapdoor will open, and the spider will attack. The spider gets one free turn, and then initiative is rolled.</p>

    <h3 id="antechamber">Antechamber</h3>
    <p>As you step into the circular room, you are greeted by three statues. The first statue is of a bearded man in robes, holding a sword. The second statue is of an armored knight, brandishing a small dagger. The third statue is of a hooded figure, their face hidden in the darkness, grasping a long staff.</p>

    <p>The weapons in the statues’ hands are real and enchanted, providing a +1 bonus to hit. When the sword is placed in the knight’s hand, the staff in the wizard’s hand, and the dagger in the thief’s hand, a portal opens in the center of the room, revealing a spiral staircase leading downwards.</p>

    <p>Suddenly, the statues spring to life, transforming into <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17025-stone-golem">Stone Golems</a>. They are hostile towards the PCs, but they are tasked with protecting this room and will not follow them if they leave the room.</p>

    <h3 id="decoy-treasury">Decoy Treasury</h3>
    <p>As you enter the room, you see that it is filled with scattered coins, as well as various weapons and pieces of armor. The items are old and dusty, but of good quality. An archaeologist might be interested in them, but for the most part, they seem unremarkable. If there was even anything of significant value here, it must have been looted long ago.</p>

    <p>One chest remains unopened, sitting in the corner of the room. If you open it, a ghostly figure escapes from within, thanking the players for freeing it. The ghost tells the players of a switch at the bottom of the chest, and suggests that they press it. When the switch is pressed, the false walls surrounding the players drop away, revealing the true treasure hidden within.</p>

    <h3 id="the-true-treasury">the True Treasury</h3>
    <p>The True Treasury is revealed to be much larger than the false walls of the Decoy Treasury. Terracotta statues depicting servants, warriors, and priests are placed throughout the room. At the center of the room sits a throne, upon which a strange suit of armor rests. The armor is a product of ancient Gnallix technology.</p>

    <p>As the players enter the room, the ghostly figure that escaped from the chest flies towards the armor, which stirs to life. It whirs and emits steam, and the ghost laughs a terrible laugh. The ghost introduces itself as Kas Tona, the high priest of Garulia, and declares that the players are foolish to have entered the sanctum of the hungry god. Kas Tona attacks the party.</p>

    <p>If Kas Tona is defeated, the treasures of the temple can be plundered at will. The treasures include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>100 gold pieces</li>
      <li>1,000 silver pieces</li>
      <li>10,000 copper pieces</li>
      <li>A large ruby worth 500 gold pieces</li>
      <li>A cleric’s spellbook containing the spells Ray of Enfeeblement, Hunger of Hadar Vampiric Touch, Enervation, and <a href="/spells/hunger-of-garulia">Hunger of Garulia</a>.</li>
      <li><a href="/equipment/armor/armor-of-kas-tona">The Armor of Kas Tona</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> 4 <em>(1,100 XP)</em></p>

    <p>Kas Tona prefers to use the Gnallix Tech Armor he wore in life to fight his battles. If the armor is destroyed or disabled, he will abandon the armor and fight on as a <a href="https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Ghost#content">ghost</a>.</p>

    <p>Kas Tona will rely on the Armor’s abilities until he exhausts its charges (10). If the charges are exhausted he will exit the armor and fight on as a <a href="https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Ghost#content">ghost</a>.</p>
