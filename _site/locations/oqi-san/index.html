        <p>Oqi-San is one of the least explored corners of Oda. It consists of dense jungle growing over a karst landscape riddled with caves and passages. The region is populated by the only known Riftland <a href="/races/vosche">Vosche</a> population that predates the Godsâ€™ War. These Vosche are culturally dissimilar to their Tradeland cousins. They reject dreams, and undergo extensive training to minimize the amount of sleep they need. To them, sleep invites nightmares, and to dream summons demons into the waking world.</p>

<p>The Oqi-San Vosche are a primitive and isolationist people. They live in small tribes in the dense jungle, subsisting on hunting and gathering. They have no contact with the outside world, and no desire for it. The Oqi-San Vosche are a warlike people, and are constantly at war with each other. Outsiders are attacked on sight.</p>
