        <p>An immense plateau of forests and towering peaks. The Hand of Boemon is said to have been raised up from below by Boemon himself during the course of the Godsâ€™ War, to serve as a fortress for his warriors. To this day, the Cult of Boemon is strongest here, and City-Kings are chosen by a vote of his priests.The temperate alpine climate and good volcanic soil makes the Hand a rich agricultural region.</p>
