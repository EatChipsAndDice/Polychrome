        <p>Before the Gods’ War, the north shores of the Riftlands were home to a race of early humans. These men stood seven feet tall, and were master stoneworkers. Their masonry is a mystery to modern men, but the most learned scholars of the Riftlands believe they had access to a potion that softened stone, and allowed them to mold it to any shape. They built immense cities dominated by high-angled pyramidal temples. They domesticated the purple banana, a powerful hallucinogen. They created plantations dedicated to the production of the fruit which was used in secret religious rituals. This race did not survive the Gods’ War, their knowledge was lost, and the jungle swallowed up their cities. The ruins are now ruled by the <a href="/races/hmonqi">Hmonqi</a>, intelligent monkeys raised to sentience by the powers of the purple banana.</p>
