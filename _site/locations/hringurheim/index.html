        <p>One of the major cities on the <a href="/locations/hand-of-boemon">Hand of Boemon</a>, Hringuerheim is a city by the water which is protected by a 500 foot wall that acts like a dam when the tides get high or there is major flooding. It’s neighboring / surrounding township is known as Deepwater, which does not have the luxury of flood protection. It is commonly known that those in the upper class proside in Hringuerheim proper while the poor and downtrodden make their home in Deepwater.</p>

<p>Hringuerheim, like other major cities on the Hand, is ruled by a city king. The city kings are selected by the preisthood of Boemon for each major city. It is not completely known if the preisthood is corrupted or not, but sometimes their selection of king proves that it makes little sense otherwise.</p>
