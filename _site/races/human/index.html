<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>Humans are a comparatively young, and the most numerous, race of intelligent humanoids on Oda.</p>

<h3 id="versatility--diversity">Versatility &amp; Diversity</h3>
<p>Humans are found in environment on Oda, from the frozen tundras of P’tlakeu to deserts of Xiyan. Humans are the most adaptable of Oda’s intelligent humanoids, and because of that, they exhibit the greatest range of cultural diversity.</p>

<h2 id="subrace-marian"><em>Subrace:</em> Marian</h2>
<h2 id="description-1">Description</h2>
<p>Marians are typically swarthy, with dark hair and features. They are generally slightly shorter and thinner than the average human. Marians have a preference for brightly colored clothing, in the most expensive fabrics they can afford.</p>

<h3 id="sons-of-the-sea">Sons of the Sea</h3>
<p>Marians are masters of the seas. They are dominate sailing, shipbuilding, and seaborne trade, across the Dead Gods’ Sea, and can be found in nearly every port on Oda.</p>

<h3 id="second-and-third-and-fourth-sons">Second (and third, and fourth..) Sons</h3>
<p>Marian women have an unusual tendency toward birthing male children. More than 3 out of 4 live Marian births are to boys, and because of this, there is a pronounced surplus of male Marians. Perhaps due to their scarcity, women in Marian society are generally more highly valued, and Marian family and political life has taken a distinctly matriarchal form.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the azure realm, where waves embrace the sky,
The Marians sail, their mastery holds the high.
With whispered winds and tides their loyal steeds,
Masters of the seas, where endless horizons lead.</p>
