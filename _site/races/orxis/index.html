<h2 id="description">Description</h2>

<h3 id="the-blood-of-the-rage-god">the Blood of the Rage God</h3>
<p>The Orxis claim that their species was born in the final days of the Gods’ War. In his battle with Herule, Oraxis, God of Rage, was cut in twain above the Blood Peaks. His intestines fell on those great mountains, and was feasted upon by jackals. These jackals were filled with lust and fury, hunting and breeding until the only thing living on the spine of the world were their offspring: the Orxis.</p>

<h3 id="mongrel-men">Mongrel Men</h3>
<p>Orxis can breed with most species of animals. This makes the race highly adaptable across diverse environments. When invading a new land, Orxis will commonly breed with the species of that region to better adapt to the area.</p>

<p>After generations of this behavior, across many regions, the Orxis species carries the traits of many animals.</p>

<h3 id="orxis-urbanism">Orxis Urbanism</h3>

<p>Domesticated Orxis are known to adjust and conform to any environment they find themselves in. Feral Orxis, on the other hand, spurn the comforts of civilized life and live nomadically, conquering and exploiting weaker people. Feral Orxis never live in cities, as they become domesticated within a generation, but do sometimes conquer them for the purposes of exploiting their resources or labor. Domesticated Orxis are prized allies within the lands of other races, as they make loyal and fierce retainers.</p>
