        <p>The Armor of Kas Tona is a rare and powerful magical armor produced by Gnallix technicians before the Godswar. The armor was originally created for industrial, not combat, applications.</p>

<p>While wearing the armor, the character has an Armor Class of 18 (no Dexterity bonus), and gains a +2 bonus to their Strength and Constitution scores.</p>

<p>The wearer must attune to the armor by wearing it for one hour. Once attuned, you can wear it without penalty, even if you are not proficient with heavy armor.</p>

<p>This armor has a number of charges, which can be used to power its various abilities. The armor has a maximum of 10 charges, and regains 1d8+2 charges at dawn each day.</p>
