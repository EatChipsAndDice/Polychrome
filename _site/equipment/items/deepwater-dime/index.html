          <p>In Deepwater, the customary price for most shady or illicit acts is ten gold coins, a price rooted more in the recognition of risk and respect than in actual value. This tradition has led to the practice of welding ten gold coins together into a single unit, commonly referred to as a “Deepwater Dime.” While the appearance of the dime suggests a full payment, it is also customary to shave the inner coins, subtly reducing the total gold weight. As a result, the actual value of most Deepwater Dimes ranges between seven and nine gold, though the symbolic gesture of offering a dime carries far more weight than its true worth.</p>
