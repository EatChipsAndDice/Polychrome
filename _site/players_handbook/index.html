<h3 id="hibernating-hulks">Hibernating Hulks</h3>
<p>Durrha mature at the same rate as humans, but they have the ability to hibernate, indefinitely, without aging. Durrha stand between six and seven feet tall, and weigh in excess of 350 pounds. Durrha skin tones range from Amber to Purple, and have a slight translucent quality. Their bodies give off a faint bioluminescent glow.</p>

<p>Your size is Medium. Your size class is Medium.</p>

<h3 id="polar-giants">Polar Giants</h3>
<p>The Durrha are large, blubbery humanoids, native to the arctic circle of Oda. The Durrha are broad and robust, and are the heaviest of the major races of Oda. Durrha skin is light in color, with undertones of red, yellow or blue. Large bone crests and knobs on their skull make their heads appear lumpy and grotesque to Oda’s other races.</p>

<p>The Durrha worship those that came before them; their ancestors are their creators, those who gave them life. This emphasis has led the Durrha to develop the most thorough genealogical records on Oda. Most Durrha can recite their lineage back ten generations, and some trace their family’s origin to the days before the Urdfall.</p>

<h3 id="timeslumber">Timeslumber</h3>
<p>The Durrha have the ability to hibernate for nearly indefinite periods of time. Durrha may do this for any number of reasons, but the most notorious is the Timefeud. Because of the importance of family to the Durrha, a wrong against their kin is considered a wrong against that Durrha itself. Darker, kin of those who wronged a Durrha are considered just as culpable. A Durrha that is unable to avenge a wrong may sleep for years, awakening to wreak vengeance on the unprepared next generation of the “family” that wronged them.</p>

<h3 id="durrha-urbanism">Durrha Urbanism</h3>

<p>Durrha live in frozen palace-complexes carved in to the ice and rock of glacial valleys. They usually take the form Ice Halls. An Ice Hall has a large ornate ceremonial gate that opens into a very large colonnaded hall. Numerous chambers and tunnels are carved out extending from the hall. Ice Halls are often arrayed with skins and bones of their ancestors; marked with records of their deeds. Durrha homes are often akin to small tombs, within which they hibernate.</p>

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>

<h3 id="the-purple-banana">the Purple Banana</h3>

<p>Hmonqi are “born” when a monkey eats a purple banana. The Purple Banana has pyschedelic effects that magically change monkeys, granting them greater intelligence and self-awareness. Hmonqi are physically indistinguishable from normal monkeys. The effects of the Banana are non-transmissable; a pregnant Hmonqi will birth a regular monkey.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/races/hmonqi-banana.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h3 id="the-banana-kingdoms">the Banana Kingdoms</h3>

<p>The Hmonqi homeland is the Northern Jungle of the western Riftlands. Hmonqi often squat in the ruins of earlier, greater civilizations. Monkey Lords rise through the highly social, and often bruta,l world of Hmonqi politics. The Lords command, through their extensive loyalty networks, huge and diverse armies. The jungle fiefdoms of the Monkey Lords are collectively known as the Banana Kingdoms.</p>

<p>Things change quick in the Kingdoms, with new Monkey Lords rising on seemingly weekly basis. A Dominant Lord will declare himself Monkey King. Hmonqi will only recognize one king as legitimate, and declaring oneself king is often a prelude to regional war.</p>

<em>the Banana Kingdoms</em></p>

<h3 id="the-hmonqi-diaspora">the Hmonqi Diaspora</h3>

<p>Many Hmonqi feel stifled under the traditional simian politics and culture of the Banana Kingdoms and choose to make their life among the othe humanoid civilizations. Hmonqi minority communities exist in cities across Oda. Some rumor that a Eastern Monkey King is forming a new Hmonqi Kingdom hidden in the wildernesses of the Tradelands.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/races/hmonqi-diaspora.png" alt="" /></p>

<h3 id="hmonqi-style">Hmonqi Style</h3>

<p>Like other monkeys, Hmonqi are small, agile and curious. Hmonqi rarely create their own cultural objects, but they do combine and “remix” the artifacts of other races. Hmonqi often adorn themselves extravagantly, preferring shiny, noisy or bright attire.</p>

<p><img src="https://open.spotify.com/track/5m6livL7ccIS92wq16n52r?si=CLalGuQySZ-cIeZKjnOstA" alt="" /></p>

<h3 id="hmonqi-urbanism">Hmonqi Urbanism</h3>

<p>Hmonqi, where they are dominant, most often live in the ruins of older, more prestigious civilizations. Hmonqi culture is essentially additive, so they never demolish, repair or maintain anything. They simply build another layer on top. Hmonqi cities are loud, garish and completely dysfunctional.

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>Humans are a comparatively young, and the most numerous, race of intelligent humanoids on Oda.</p>

<h3 id="versatility--diversity">Versatility &amp; Diversity</h3>
<p>Humans are found in environment on Oda, from the frozen tundras of P’tlakeu to deserts of Xiyan. Humans are the most adaptable of Oda’s intelligent humanoids, and because of that, they exhibit the greatest range of cultural diversity.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2 id="subrace-marian"><em>Subrace:</em> Marian</h2>
<h2 id="description-1">Description</h2>
<p>Marians are typically swarthy, with dark hair and features. They are generally slightly shorter and thinner than the average human. Marians have a preference for brightly colored clothing, in the most expensive fabrics they can afford.</p>

<h3 id="sons-of-the-sea">Sons of the Sea</h3>
<p>Marians are masters of the seas. They are dominate sailing, shipbuilding, and seaborne trade, across the Dead Gods’ Sea, and can be found in nearly every port on Oda.</p>

<h3 id="second-and-third-and-fourth-sons">Second (and third, and fourth..) Sons</h3>
<p>Marian women have an unusual tendency toward birthing male children. More than 3 out of 4 live Marian births are to boys, and because of this, there is a pronounced surplus of male Marians. Perhaps due to their scarcity, women in Marian society are generally more highly valued, and Marian family and political life has taken a distinctly matriarchal form.</p>

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>

<h3 id="the-blood-of-the-rage-god">the Blood of the Rage God</h3>
<p>The Orxis claim that their species was born in the final days of the Gods’ War. In his battle with Herule, Oraxis, God of Rage, was cut in twain above the Blood Peaks. His intestines fell on those great mountains, and was feasted upon by jackals. These jackals were filled with lust and fury, hunting and breeding until the only thing living on the spine of the world were their offspring: the Orxis.</p>

<h3 id="mongrel-men">Mongrel Men</h3>
<p>Orxis can breed with most species of animals. This makes the race highly adaptable across diverse environments. When invading a new land, Orxis will commonly breed with the species of that region to better adapt to the area.</p>

<p>After generations of this behavior, across many regions, the Orxis species carries the traits of many animals.</p>

<h3 id="orxis-urbanism">Orxis Urbanism</h3>

<p>Domesticated Orxis are known to adjust and conform to any environment they find themselves in. Feral Orxis, on the other hand, spurn the comforts of civilized life and live nomadically, conquering and exploiting weaker people. Feral Orxis never live in cities, as they become domesticated within a generation, but do sometimes conquer them for the purposes of exploiting their resources or labor. Domesticated Orxis are prized allies within the lands of other races, as they make loyal and fierce retainers.

<h3 id="fierce-sentinels">Fierce Sentinels</h3>

<p>Tulgg society focuses on the tribe and it’s stewardship of the land. Tulgg tribes prefer remote forests, high mountain passes, and other areas remote enough to avoid the taint of city life. For many centuries, the Tulgg had lost homelands to the urban world’s unending hunger for wood, iron, game.</p>

<p>In their role as guardians of the wild, Tulgg often tend towards the fanatic - giving themselves to causes greater than themselves. Frequently this devotion is to their stewardship, often to gods. In rare cases a Tulgg might even grant this bond to another person.</p>

<h3 id="food-and-medicine">Food and Medicine</h3>

<p>Like humans, most Tulgg are omnivorous - although some observe dietary restrictions for religious or cultural reasons - despite the rumors, cannibalism, or the consumption of humanoids, is generally as taboo in Tulg society as it is in others.</p>

<p>Tulgg lore of medicinal &amp; efficacious herbs &amp; botanicals is unparalleled - they keep extensive seed library caches - adding to these libraries is a noble calling among the Tulgg.</p>

<p>Tulgg build minimal communal structures to provide safety and crucial support. Most productive and recreational activity happens outside of these structures, in the Tulggan hinterland. Tulggan hinterlands look like wilderness to outsiders, but actually represent generations of growing, pruning, shaping and transplanting to create a more predictable, defensible and productive environment for the Tulgg tribes.</p>

<p>Tulgg designs are often inspired by the nests, warrens, dams and hives of Oda’s wildlife.</p>

<h3 id="vosche-society">Vosche Society</h3>

<p>Structure and chaos. The Vosche have rigid cultural rules regarding a variety of political and social behavior. To an outsider, they may seem trivial or absurd, but thats because they are tailored to the needs of the Vosche and no one else. Regardless of where you stand in the Vosche hegemony, the ceremonies and rituals that have developed to maintain cultural identity and preserve the link to the Dream, are available to everyone willing. Almost everyone is compelled to go through these bench marks of Vosche tribal indoctrination, even those who were raised outside of the sphere of Vosche influence. Orphans raised by other races reach adolescence and develop a powerful wanderlust to return to the Vosche territories, even if they know nothing about where they are.</p>

<h3 id="wild-vosche-and-city-vosche">Wild Vosche and City Vosche</h3>

<p>The people of dreams are wanderers. Compelled by an irresistible instinct to migrate, the Vosche who are called, travel en mass to a new location. The time frame for these migrations have never revealed a pattern to them, but it is very disruptive to progress and stability. Luckily, the Vosche have embraced this feature of their existence and adapted to be flexible to the calling. The sites they settle are unusual as they almost always are the locations of previously abandoned Vosche cities. While their cities grow quickly from there, there is an obsession with trying discover the history and secrets of the previous inhabitants, who always seem to have known more then them.</p>

<h3 id="leaders-of-visions">Leaders of visions</h3>

<p>There once was a time when the Vosche were masters of their dreams to such a degree they could carry wonderful knowledge back into the waking world. The lords of the Vosche would rule from their slumber, sleeping for long stretches and sharing their visions with the others in dreams. The waking world of the Vosche was busy with the fulfilment of these visions. Art, buildings, magic and progress. The limits were endless but as the horizon of possibilities stretched, so did caution. Oraksus punished the Vosche, destroying their greatest city. Their patron, Sihn, sacrificed himself to save what remained and entered an eternal slumber. The Vosche lost their visions when returning to the waking world. The Vision Lords were all dead or corrupted, their powerful gift turned them monsters, their dreams infecting the Vosche with waking nightmares. An age of darkness descended and great evil was committed. Many moons passed without a single vision lord being born who was not of a stain heart. They moved from city to city only finding abandoned destruction from the previous residents. Some people stayed to resettle the ruined cities while others renounced their former dwellings to carve new beginnings. A few left to live in the wild, returning to the ancient teachings of dream walking in an attempt to reconnect with the Sleeping God.</p>

<p>The people who live in the wild territories have been somewhat successful in reintegration to their previous relationship with their dreams. A youth came back from a dream walk ceremony with strange powers and some of the abilities lost in the breaking. He claimed to have found where the Sleeping God lays and spoke with him. He pledged his soul to serve the will of Sihn in the waking world, in exchange, he would grant the youth with the power of dreaming. The youth became the first manifestation of what are now know as a Dream Knight. Soon after this encounter, others came to be touched by Sihn through their dreams. These wild Vosche took the news back to the cities and new orders of worship were founded. The god of the great dream had returned and repaired a thread of tapestry the Vosche once wove.
