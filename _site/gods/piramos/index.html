          <p>God of love, seduction, music and oratory. He is depicted as a regal, fit and youthful man. He is shown wearing a cape of iridescent feathers, and wields a gold club with which he knocks lovers senseless. His hair is blonde and braided with gold wires. Piramos is known for his fondness of seducing the women of Oda, often in the form of birds, and fathering many semi-divine children. His symbol is two interlocked rings.</p>
