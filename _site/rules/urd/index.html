        <h3 id="urd">Urd</h3>

<p>Urd is a rare and enigmatic radioactive metal that originates from space, primarily arriving on the material plane in the form of meteorites. This extraterrestrial substance possesses unique properties that make it highly sought after by arcane practitioners and craftsmen alike.</p>

<h4 id="physical-characteristics">Physical Characteristics</h4>

<p>Urd is a lustrous, silvery metal with a faint, otherworldly glow. It is often found embedded in meteoritic rock, making its extraction a challenging endeavor. Smooth and cold to the touch, Urd feels unusually dense and heavy compared to other metals of similar size. Urd emits a subtle, shimmering aura that can be perceived by those attuned to magic. This radiation, while not immediately harmful, has peculiar effects on living beings who come into contact with it.</p>

<h4 id="arcane-properties">Arcane Properties</h4>

<p>Urd is an exceptional conductor of magical energy, capable of channeling, amplifying, generating, and storing arcane power far beyond the capabilities of terrestrial metals. This makes it a favored material for crafting magical objects, such as wands, staves, and enchanted armor. When used in spellcasting implements, Urd can enhance the potency and effectiveness of spells, making them more powerful or extending their duration. Its ability to generate and store arcane energy also allows for the creation of self-sustaining magical devices and powerful arcane batteries.</p>

<h4 id="handling-urd">Handling Urd</h4>

<p>Despite its valuable properties, handling Urd comes with inherent risks. Prolonged exposure or direct contact with the metal can lead to a variety of strange and unpredictable effects on living beings. These effects are not typically harmful but can be highly disruptive, making caution essential for those who work with Urd.</p>

<h4 id="uses-in-crafting">Uses in Crafting</h4>

<p>Artificers and enchanters prize Urd for its ability to enhance magical items. Items crafted with Urd are often more powerful, offering increased spell amplification, stable arcane energy conduction, and the ability to generate and store magical power. Wands, staves, and orbs made with Urd provide superior control over spellcasting, allowing for more precise and potent magical effects. Enchanted armor and weapons incorporating Urd can provide unique advantages in combat, such as increased protection against magical attacks or enhanced offensive capabilities.</p>

<h4 id="availability">Availability</h4>

<p>Due to its extraterrestrial origin, Urd is extremely rare and highly valuable. Meteorites containing Urd are typically small and scattered, making them difficult to locate and recover. As a result, items crafted with Urd are often considered priceless relics, treasured by those fortunate enough to possess them.</p>

<h4 id="safety-precautions">Safety Precautions</h4>

<p>When working with Urd, it is crucial to take safety precautions to mitigate its strange effects. Handling the metal with protective gear, limiting exposure time, and storing it in lead-lined containers can help reduce the risk of adverse reactions. Additionally, it is advisable to undergo regular magical cleansing rituals to counteract any lingering effects of Urd exposure.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="so-you-took-the-urd-d100">So, You Took the Urdâ€¦ <em>(D100)</em></h2>

<p>When you come into close contact with Urd, it can have strange, even dangerous, effects. If you are within 10 feet of Urd for more than 1 hour, you must roll on the following chart. If you continue to remain in proximity to Urd, you must roll on the chart again at every long rest.</p>
