          <p>In the matriarchal society of the Marians, younger sons are cast upon the vast, unforgiving waters to carve their destiny from the ebb and flow of the ocean tides. These sons, carrying the title ‘Sons of the Sea’, are expected to navigate their fate amidst pirates, mercurial storms, and distant shores veiled in mystery. Their lineage serves as both a curse and a boon - a name honored yet severed from the maternal hearth, a wanderer by decree with a heart tethered to the veiled matriarchal courts of their homeland.</p>

<p>As a Son of the Sea, you bear the salt-streaked mark of a mariner, trader, or mercenary. Your family expects you to cast your own fortune beyond the Marian shores, to extend the unseen arms of their influence, and relay tales of distant realms back to your homeland. In the world beyond, you may find your brothers of the sea, fellow castaways from the Marian lineage, as comrades or competition, united by blood, yet often set at odds by the ceaseless quest for renown and wealth.</p>

<h3 id="equipment">Equipment</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A set of traveler’s clothes</li>
  <li>a signet of your Marian lineage</li>
  <li>a map of important maritime routes</li>
  <li>a trinket from your homeland</li>
  <li>a belt pouch containing 10 gp</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="feature-oceanborn-network">Feature: Oceanborn Network</h3>

<p>Your birthright as a Marian has enmeshed you in a clandestine maritime network, a loose alliance of merchants, mercenaries, and mariners all bound by Marian blood. Within any coastal or riverfront settlement, you can find shelter, fresh supplies, or potential job opportunities through this network. The nature of these relations can be competitive or collaborative, but a shared lineage often ensures a minimum of hospitality among the Sons of the Seas.</p>

<h3 id="suggested-characteristics">Suggested Characteristics</h3>

<p>Sons of the Seas often bear a melancholy longing for the familial warmth they were severed from, tempered with a rugged, restless spirit forged in the furnace of the open seas. Their personalities are as varied as the waters they traverse; some are boisterous and flamboyant, eager to carve their names under the sun, while others are contemplative, finding solace in the eternal rhythm of tides and stars. Their hearts echo with the thrum of adventure, a longing to prove their worth to the faceless matriarchs whose favor they were born without, and to etch their tales upon the endless canvas of the sea and sky.</p>
