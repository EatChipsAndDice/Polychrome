        <p>Tradespeak is the common tongue of the Tradelands. It is derived from High Marian, the ancient language spoken by the Marian people. Due to their preeminence in maritime activity, a simplified pidgin form of their language has become something of a universal language among traders and travelers. While High Marian has been retained as a liturgical and literary language, most Marians speak Tradespeak as their first, and often only, language. Most inhabitants of port cities also speak it, in addition to their own local languages. The further inland one travels the less common, and more limited, speakers of Tradespeak become.</p>

A large gem on the ground
He sold it to a king
And made his fortune sing
