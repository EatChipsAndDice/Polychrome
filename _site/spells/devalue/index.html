        <p>You change the composition of an object or objects made of precious minerals, up to your character level times 50lbs, to a less valuable mineral. For example, you can turn gold into copper or tin, or turn diamond into quartz or glass. This changes the physical properties of the object; it does not create an illusion or imbue the object with magic. Devalue can only be used to make an object less valuable than it was originally; for example, you cannot use this spell to turn a simple stone statue into ruby or gold.</p>

<p>You can cast this spell again as Revalue to restore a previously altered object to its original form.</p>

  <dd>When you cast this spell using a higher-level spell slot, you can affect up to an additional 100lbs of material for each spell level above 3rd.</dd>
