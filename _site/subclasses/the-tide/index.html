<p><strong>Abilities</strong></p>

<p><strong>Covert Communication</strong>
At 3rd level, agents are trained in a sophisticated system of secret signs and encrypted messages. You gain proficiency in the Deception and Persuasion skills. If you are already proficient, you may double your proficiency.</p>

<p><strong>Economic Sabotage</strong>
By 6th level, agents are skilled in the art of economic disruption. Once per long rest, you can choose to disrupt a business or trade operation within a city. This action can cause a target enterprise to lose significant revenue, leading to a temporary shutdown or loss of influence in the local market. The effect lasts for 1d4 days, during which time the enterprise’s operations are halved in efficiency.</p>

<p><strong>Deep Cover Operations</strong>
At 14th level, your ability to infiltrate and blend into enemy organizations reaches its peak. You gain proficiency with the Disguise Kit if you do not already have it, and may double your proficiency when using it. Furthermore, you have access to the faction’s network of false documents, safehouses, and forged credentials, giving you a seamless cover identity for any mission.</p>

<p><strong>Master of Tides</strong>
Reaching 20th level signifies your mastery over the clandestine arts and your pivotal role within The Tide. You can command significant resources and personnel of The Tide for major operations. Additionally, once per month, you can call upon The Tide to perform one major act of espionage, sabotage, or economic manipulation that can significantly alter the course of political or economic events in a region.</p>

<p><strong>Faction Features</strong></p>

<p><strong>Tide’s Whisper</strong>
Members of The Tide carry a special emblem, known as the Tide’s Whisper, which serves as a spellcasting focus for their operations. This emblem also grants them safe passage and anonymous access to hidden safehouses and caches maintained by the faction across various ports and cities.</p>

<p>With these refined abilities and structures, The Tide remains one of the most elusive and powerful factions within Alamar, playing a crucial role in maintaining Alamar’s supremacy and the strategic balance of power throughout the Marian archipelago.</p>
