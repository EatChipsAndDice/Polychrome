        <p>The Condottiero is a fighter subclass that excels in inspiring their allies, as well as using their fearsome reputation and presence to intimidate their enemies. They are known for their skill in military strategy and their ability to command forces in battle. Many condottieri are also skilled diplomats, and they are often used as intermediaries in negotiations between rival factions or states.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Inspiration</dt>
  <dd>At 3rd level, the Condottiero can use their charisma to inspire their teammates, giving them an Inspiration die (a d6) to use during an encounter. The number of Inspiration Dice the Condottiero can give out is equal to their Charisma modifier. This ability can be used as an action and is regained after a short rest.</dd>
  <dt>Legionary Discipline</dt>
  <dd>At 7th level, the Condottiero’s discipline extends to their allies, granting them advantage on saving throws against fear effects and charms as long as they can see or hear the Condottiero.</dd>
  <dt>Fearsome Reputation</dt>
  <dd>At 10th level, the Condottiero can use their intimidating presence to frighten a creature within 30 feet as an action. The creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against the Condottiero’s Passive Intimidation score (10 + Intimidation + Charisma modifier) or become frightened.</dd>
  <dt>Inspiring Speech</dt>
  <dd>At 15th level, the Condottiero’s inspiring speech allows their allies to regain twice as many hit points during a short rest.</dd>
  <dt>Fearsome Presence</dt>
  <dd>At 18th level, the Condottiero’s fearsome presence becomes even more potent, causing any creature that wishes to attack them to first make a Wisdom saving throw against the Condottiero’s Passive Intimidation score or become frightened. Creatures that pass this check are free to attack the Condottiero for the rest of the encounter.</dd>
